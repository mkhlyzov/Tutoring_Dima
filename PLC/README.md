## ðŸ“š Learning Resources

### Intro to compilers, Interpreters, etcetera
- [Understanding AOT Compilers, JIT Compilers, and Interpreters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rn_MAspYFM) - Overview of different types of compilers and interpreters. This video explains the differences between Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-in-Time (JIT) compilers, along with how interpreters work in modern programming languages.
- [Just In Time (JIT) Compilers - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7KHAVaX_Rs) - A deeper dive into how JIT compilers function, specifically in relation to Java and other high-performance languages.

### Java YouTube courses
- [Nice Course on Java Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL8woMHwr36EDxjUoCzboZjedsnhLP1j4) - A comprehensive series of videos explaining Java from basic to advanced levels. The playlist also includes full video transcriptions, available in the video descriptions.
- [Random but Informative Java Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhfHPmPYPPRk6yMrcbfafFGSbE2EPK_A6)- This course covers many useful topics, but the flow can feel chaotic at times.

### Rust Online Materials
- [**Rust Website**](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Rust Book](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn), also translated to many languages, see Appendix
- [Rust Online Compiler](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021) - lets you compile+run small programs in browser w/o having to manually create files locally and manage them from terminal.
- [Rust Book experiment](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html) - similar to the original book, but restructured and contains small quizes. English version only.
